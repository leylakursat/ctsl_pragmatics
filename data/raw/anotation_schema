different attempts are separated by commas in gloss, pos_sequence, order_interest

gloss = lexical items/meaning of each unit, attempts separated by commas
pos_sequence = pos sequence of gloss with repetitions (noun, color, size, num, mod, loc, verb, prep)
    if the unit refers directly to the intended referent marked without numbers, if not marked with numbers
    ? for not sure
    mod for other
    - for at the same time
    mod is for modifiers that denote an adjective other than color, size and number
    point(color) in gloss is coded as color, point(else) is coded as noun if else is a noun
    "hat man" is coded as "mod noun" when it's used to refer to the man with the hat --> turkish "sapkali adam" == "hatted man"
    if same noun --> noun noun verb noun, if different --> noun noun2 verb noun2

mouthing = words that are mouthed 
pointing = this is only for pointing to crayons, if pointing is used as a lexical strategy thats marked in notes
notes = negation* (can also be extracted), check sign*, no crayons

OBSERVATIONS---
negation order very very stable -- neg marker = "degil"

ZAFER
gets crayons on 6th trial
mouths almost everything - only marked ones i was sure about.. i'm good at catching his mouthing for 'small' but that's mostly because i'm used to it not because he signs it a lot

ILKNUR
negation!!
mouths everything except phonologically very complex words

MUSTAFA
gets crayons on 9th trial
negation!!


FATMA TEYZE
moves lips but not mouthing? but there are patterns..

TODO:
- make sure the order_interest of adjective ordering trials only have "mod" for all modifiers --> will dissect this further into categories later (size vs dimension)
- make sure COLOR is coded as "clr"
- change long-nose to elephant!!
- different sign for dog, red, wood
- pot very lexicalized (includes two signs --> hold-from-two-sides flames)
- chicken, cow, apple lexicalized
